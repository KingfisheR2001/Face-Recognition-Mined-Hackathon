# Face-Recognition-Mined-Hackathon
In this project, our team's task is to identify the human face in real time from a CCTV camera with the help of computer Vision. If CCTV camera frame (image from the Video) contains multiple faces, then developed model must have capability to recognize all the faces in frame.
After recognition of faces developed, Software will return the face identity (For Example Employee Code) and Date and time of recognition in a csv file.

## Tech Stack
***IDE:***  Microsoft Visual Studio \
***Language:***  Python \
**Modules:** face_recognition, cv2 
## Features
* Multiple face recognition
* Real time attendance in csv file for the known faces given in dataset
* "Unknown" title for faces not in dataset

## Setup 
* Step 1:-
Install cmake from its official website (https://cmake.org/download/) and make sure to choose the right version according to your system configuration.
(While installing cmake select Add CMake to the system PATH to avoid any error in the next steps)

* Step 2:-
Install visual studio community version from the official website (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) and after that select Desktop development with C++ while installing Visual Studio.

* Step 3:-
Go to your command prompt and type “pip install cmake”


* Step 4:-
Go ahead and install dlib library using “pip install dlib”
Now we are ready to use the face recognition.

* Step 5:-
Go ahead and install opencv library using “pip install opencv-python”
Now we are ready to use the cv2 module.
